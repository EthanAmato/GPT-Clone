    "- Attention is a **communication mechanism.** Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating into a single value with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them with data-dependent weights \n",
    "- There is no notion of space\n",
    "- There is no communication across batch dimensions\n",
    "- Attention block doesn't necessarily have to only communicate backwards (E.g. Token at Pos 5 will never look forward to Pos 6 to choose what token it should be). In some cases you may want to have all tokens talk to each other (e.g. sentiment analysis where future context words may shed a different light on previous ones). To create such an encoder block, all you have to do is delete wei = wei.masked_fill(tril == 0, float('-inf')), because that removes the mask of -inf and allows for aggregates at all Ts regardless of temporal position\n",
    "    - What we have currently is called a decoder block\n",
    "- There is also something called cross-attention. This block of code is called self-attention because the keys, queries, and values are all coming from the same source (x). However, there can be a case where your queries come from x but key and values come from another source. \n",
    "    - Called cross attention if there is a separate pool of nodes that we want to pool information from \n",
    "- Scaled self attention additionally divides wei by 1/sqrt(head_size) - this makes it so when input Query, Key are dot producted, the resulting variance will be preserved to approximately 1 as opposed to the order of head_size\n",
    "    - Prevents softmax from being way too peaky because with multiplication it tends to optimize towards the max values, leading to high variance"
